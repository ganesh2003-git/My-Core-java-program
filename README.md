# My Core Java Programs ☕

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed during my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** coursework. It covers fundamental concepts, object-oriented programming, and various logic-building exercises.

## 🚀 About the Project
As a developer interested in Software Development, I have curated these programs to demonstrate my understanding of Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **Basics:** Input/Output, Loops, and Decision Making.
* **OOP Concepts:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
* **Data Structures:** Implementation of Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists using Java.
* **Collections:** Usage of ArrayList, HashMap, and other collection frameworks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
